# RestaurantManagementSystem_CppProject


This C++ program is a comprehensive restaurant management system designed to streamline the ordering process. It enables users to place detailed orders from various categories and subcategories of food items, offering flexibility and convenience. After finalizing the order, users are prompted to input their personal details, including name, phone number, and delivery address. The program calculates and displays the final bill, ensuring transparency and accuracy in the billing process.

Additionally, the system includes a feature that allows users to change the prices of items; the next time an item from that category is selected, the updated prices are displayed. Finally, the system prints a personalized thank you message and confirms that the order will be promptly delivered to the provided address. This user-friendly system enhances the overall dining experience by making the ordering process efficient, organized, and adaptable.
